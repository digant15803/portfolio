ðŸ”— About Me

"Passionate Building Large-Scale Distributed Systems. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’» #CoderLife"

I am performance-driven Computer Science grad student at Arizona State University, deeply fascinated by backend engineering, distributed systems, and cloud-native technologies. I love designing and developing end to end real-time, large-scale systems that push the limits of performance and scalability. My toolbox includes C/C++, Python, Golang, Java, Node.js, Redis, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and AWS - and I am always eager to learn the next technology that helps systems scale seamlessly.

ðŸ‘‰ If it scales, I am into it.
