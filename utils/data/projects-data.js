        description: "Built an end-to-end cloud–edge face recognition pipeline achieving an average latency of just 200ms. The system leverages an IoT → Greengrass → SQS → Lambda workflow, where IoT cameras publish frames over MQTT, an EC2-hosted Greengrass component performs edge-based MTCNN face detection, and a Lambda function handles recognition with results returned through an SQS response queue. To ensure scalability and consistency, Lambda functions were containerized with Docker and deployed via ECR. By offloading detection to the edge, the solution reduced cloud communication latency by 35% while maintaining secure, encrypted channels between IoT devices and cloud services.",
